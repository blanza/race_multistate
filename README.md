# Abstract

Although the existence of racial fluidity in Brazil and in the United States is generally
accepted, in both Brazil and the United States, changes in racial classification over the
life course are often not incorporated into standard demographic estimates.

By taking a multistate perspective on the variability of racial classification, we can use
demographic methods to ask new questions about the nature of racial fluidity in Brazil,
such as: How many years can someone born into theclassified as White, Brown, or
Black categories at birth expect to live in a different racial categorye? At what ages are
changes in racial classification transitions between races more likely to occur?

We compute multistate life tables using linked data from Brazil’s largest household
survey (2017-2019 PNAD-C) to estimate transition probabilities between the White,
Brown, and Black race categories, which we combine with age- and race-specific
mortality probabilities.

Transition probabilities reveal that, up to age 65, Brazilians are more likely to be
reclassified from either White or Black to Brown than they are to die at each age.
Conditional life expectancy estimates show that Brazilians who were classified as Black
at birth can expect to live almost 15 years of their lives classified as White, while those
classified as White at birth can expect to live, on average, three years classified as
Black.

We provide important new evidence on the extent of racial fluidity in contemporary
Brazil and demonstrate the feasibility of accounting for this fluidity in traditional
demographic analysis.
